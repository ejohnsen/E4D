Installation
------------

The cocos3d framework is built on cocos2d. Before installing cocos3d,
you must download and install the cocos2d SDK from

http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/download


Unzip the cocos3d distribution file (which you've probably already done,
otherwise you wouldn't be reading this document).

Open a Terminal session, navigate to the unzipped cocos3d distribution
directory and run the install-cocos3d script as follows:

./install-cocos3d.sh -f -2 "relative-path-to-cocos2d-sources"

For example:

./install-cocos3d.sh -f -2 "../../cocos2d/cocos2d-iphone-1.0.1"

The cocos2d source code must be available and identified using the -2 switch
so that the installer can copy the cocos2d libraries to the cocos3d templates
and demo projects.

That's it!


cocos2d Version Compatibility
-----------------------------

cocos3d 0.7.1 is compatible with cocos2d versions 0.99.5 through 1.1.

At the time of this release, the current version of cocos2d is 1.0.1, and by default, cocos3d is
configured to use that version. This section includes notes on compatibility with other versions.

   cocos2d 0.9.5
   -------------

   Version 0.99.5 of cocos2d contains several files that were removed in cocos2d 1.0,
   These files are not included in the cocos3d Xcode demo apps and project templates.
   When using cocos2d 0.9.5, drag the following files to the cocos2d group within the Xcode project:

      cocos2d/CCCompatibility.h
      cocos2d/CCCompatibility.m
      cocos2d/CCSpriteSheet.h
      cocos2d/CCSpriteSheet.m
      TouchJSON/Extensions/NSCharacterSet_Extensions.h
      TouchJSON/Extensions/NSCharacterSet_Extensions.m
      TouchJSON/Extensions/NSScanner_Extensions.h
      TouchJSON/Extensions/NSScanner_Extensions.m

   Because of the modular nature of Xcode 4 project templates, the cocos3d Xcode 4 template
   project uses whichever cocos2d Xcode 4 project templates were installed. Typically this
   will be the cocos2d 1.0.1 project templates, unless you have created cocos2d 0.99.5
   Xcode 4 project templates.


GCC 4.2 Compiler Warnings
-------------------------

cocos3d can be compiled by either Apple's recommended 'Apple LLVM Compiler 3.1' (aka Clang),
or the older 'LLVM GCC 4.2' compiler. However, the 'LLVM GCC 4.2' compiler will generate a
number of deprecation warnings about the deprecated cocos3d class CC3TargettingNode.

To remove these warnings, we recommend moving to the 'Apple LLVM Compiler 3.1' compiler.
If that is not possible, you can remove these warnings by removing any dependency in your
code on the CC3TargettingNode and CC3World classes, and then removing the 'deprecated'
group from your project in Xcode.


Creating Your First cocos3d Project
-----------------------------------

To get started with your first cocos3d project, open Xcode 4, click on the
File->New->NewProject... menu selection, and select the 'cocos3d Application'
project template from the cocos3d template group.

The template project starts with a working 3D variation on the familiar
'hello, world' application, and you can use it as a starting point for
your own application.


Documentation
-------------

The cocos3d Programming Guide is online at:

	http://brenwill.com/2011/cocos3d-programming-guide/.

The API documentation is online at:

	http://brenwill.com/docs/cocos3d/0.7.1/api/

You can create a local copy of the API documentation using Doxygen to extract the
documentation from the source files. There is a Doxygen configuration file to output
the API documents in the same format as appears online in the folder Docs/API within
the cocos3d distribution.


Demo Applications
-----------------

The best way to understand what cocos3d can do is to look at the examples and code
in the demo applications that are included in the cocos3d distribution. These demos,
particularly the CC3DemoMashUp app, will help you understand how to use cocos3d,
and demonstrate many of the key features and capabilities of cocos3d.

For convenience, to access all of the demos together, open the 'cocos3d.xcworkspace'
Xcode workspace. You can also open each demo project individually in the Demos folder.

If you are using cocos2d 0.99.5, read the cocos2d Version Compatibility selection
below regarding running the demo apps with that version.

The following demo apps are included in the cocos3d distribution:


   CC3DemoMashUp
   -------------

   Please read the class notes of the CC3DemoMashUpScene class for a full description of how to
   run and interact with this demo, and what features it covers.

   Your camera hovers over a scene that includes animated robots, bouncing beach-balls,
   spinning globes, and a selection of animated teapots. This is a sophisticated demo that
   showcases many interesting features of cocos3d, including:

     - loading mesh models, cameras and lights from 3D model files stored in the PowerVR POD format
     - creating mesh models from static header file data
     - sharing mesh data across several nodes with different materials

     - creating and deploying many independent copies of a node, while sharing the underlying mesh data
     - drawing a descriptive text label on a node using CC3Node shouldDrawDescriptor property.
     - drawing a wireframe bounding box around a node using CC3Node shouldDrawWireframeBox property.
     - automatically zooming the camera out to view all objects in the scene
     - constructing and drawing a highly tessellated rectangular plane mesh using CC3PlaneNode
     - caching mesh data into GL vertex buffer objects and releasing vertex data from application memory
     - retaining vertex location data in application memory (retainVertexLocations) for subsequent calculations

     - using pinch and pan gestures to control the movement of the 3D camera
     - using tap gestures to select 3D objects, and pan gestures to spin 3D objects
  
   In addition, there are a number of interesting options for you to play with by uncommenting
   certain lines of code in the methods of this class that build objects in the 3D scene,
   including experimenting with:
     - simple particle generator with multi-colored, light-interactive, particles
     - different options for ordering nodes when drawing, including ordering by mesh or texture
     - translucent and transparent textures (addFloatingRing)
     - configuring the camera for parallel/isometric/orthographic projection instead of the default
       perpective projection
     - mounting the camera on a moving object, in this case a bouncing ball
     - mounting the camera on a moving object, in this case a bouncing ball, and having the
       camera stay focused on the rainbow teapot as both beach ball and teapot move and rotate
     - directing an object to track another object, always facing that object, but only
       rotating in one direction (eg- side-to-side, but not up and down).
     - displaying 2D labels (eg- health-bars) overlayed on top of the 3D scene at locations projected from the position of 3D objects
     - disabling animation for a particular node, in this case the camera and light

     - displaying a dynamic bounding box on a 3D particle emitter.
     - making use of a fixed bounding volume for the 3D particle emitter to improve performance.



   CC3Demo3DTiles
   --------------

   A simple demo that lays out multiple small cocos3d scenes as layers in a larger cocos2d
   layer. The effect is a grid of tiles, with each tile displaying a separate 3D scene,
   each containing its own camera and lighting. The main node in each 3D tile can be rotated
   under touch control.

   This demonstrates the ability to simply include 3D objects in an otherwise 2D game,
   and techniques for optimizing under those conditions. It also demonstrates touch control
   when many 3D scene are visible concurrently, and the ability to add app data to nodes
   using the userData property.

   The CC3Demo3DTiles demo app also demonstrates the use of the cocos2d RootController with cocos3d.



   CC3Performance
   --------------

   This is a simple demo of the performance characteristics of cocos3d. It demonstrates
   how to collect statistics about your application's performance. In doing so, it
   presents a number of model scenarios, and through the user interface, you can control
   the type of model loaded and how many copies to render.

   You can dynamically experiment with how different model types, sizes and quantities
   affects the performance of cocos3d. You can also use this performance demo app to
   compare performance across different device types.


If you are using cocos2d 1.1 or 0.99.5, read the cocos2d Version Compatibility selection below
regarding running the demo apps with that version.


Demo Models
-----------

Some of the POD models that appear in the demo and template apps were designed in Blender,
exported to DAE, and converted to POD files using the PowerVR Collada2POD converter.

As a reference for the creation of your own 3D models for use in cocos3d, you can find
the original Blender files and DAE files for these POD models in the Models folder in
the cocos3d distribution.


Creating POD 3D Model Files
---------------------------

The PowerVR SDK contains tools for converting from a limited number of 3D editor export
files. The PVR SDK is available free from Imagination Technologies, the supplier of the
GPU's used in iOS devices. You can download the PowerVR SDK from:

http://www.imgtec.com/powervr/insider/sdk/KhronosOpenGLES1xMBX.asp

If you are using Blender (or any 3D editor), you can export your 3D model to a file in
Collada 1.4 format, and used the Collada2POD converter tool (GUI or command line) in the
PVR SDK to convert the Collada file to POD format.

For convenience, when using the Collada2POD tool, you can use the settings in the
Tools/Collada2PODSettings.txt file in the cocos3d distribution. When using the
Collada2POD GUI converter, please be aware that the tool does not store the setting
for the Invert Transparency flag. This flag must be turned on each time you use the
GUI tool to avoid having all your models disappear.

Please also note that the Collada2POD tool rotates data so that the Z-axis is 'up'.
Since the OpenGL ES default is to have the Y-axis as up, and the camera looking down
the -Z-axis, it is usually more convenient to use the OpenGL orientation in cocos3d
(although there's nothing to stop you from rotating everything by 90 degrees in cocos3d).

With this in mind, when using Blender, and exporting to POD via Collada, orient your
model scene so that 'up' is along the Z-axis (which is the Blender default anyway).
The Collada2POD tool will then rotate the axes so that 'up' is along the Y-axis when
the model is imported into cocos3d.


PowerVR Library
---------------

In order to reduce the size of the cocos3d distribution, several large and
unused files have been removed from the PVR library. More info can be found
in the document: 'cocos3d/cc3PVR/PVRT 2.09/PVRT_Removed_Files.txt'.
